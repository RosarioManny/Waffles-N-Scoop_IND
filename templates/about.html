    <p>
      Meet Mr. Harold "Harry" Thompson, the 70-year-old ice cream artisan whose life has been a delightful swirl of passion and perseverance. 
      Since his teenage years, Harry has been crafting ice cream, starting in his grandmother’s buisness. Using the hand-cranked machine and turning his love for 
      the craft into a thriving business, Waffle N' Scoop. For over five decades, he’s poured his heart into every batch, creating flavors 
      that range from classic vanilla bean to inventive delights like lavender honey and salted caramel pretzel. But for Harry, it’s not just about
      the ice cream—it’s about the joy it brings. “Ice cream is my happiness,” he says, his hands dusted with powdered sugar. “When I see someone’s
      face light up after that first bite, it fills my heart. This isn’t just a business—it’s my life’s work.” Harry’s dedication and kindness have made 
      him a local legend, spreading sweetness, one scoop at a time.
